\subsection [sSec:suctionClap] {Suction duct flap}

The suction system generates an airflow from the suction mouth or manual suction hose (optional accessory) to the dirt hopper.

A hand||operated flap (\inF[fig:suctionClap], \atpage[fig:suctionClap]) is used to switch the airflow between the suction mouth and manual suction hose.

\placefig [here] [fig:suctionClap] {Suction duct flap}
{\startcombination [2*1]
{\externalfigure [work:suctionClap:open]}{Suction duct open}
{\externalfigure [work:suctionClap:closed]}{Suction duct closed}
\stopcombination}

When operating as normal~– working with the suction mouth~– the suction duct has to be open (switching lever up).

The suction duct must be closed (switching lever down) in order to use the manual suction hose. This redirects the airflow through the manual suction hose.

The \sdeux\ can be fitted with an optional\index{Manual suction hose} manual suction hose. It is mounted on the dirt hopper hatch and is easy to operate.

{\sla Requirements:}

The dirt hopper must be fully lowered; the \sdeux\ must be in \aW{working} mode (see \in{Section}[sec:using:start], \atpage[sec:using:start]).

\item Press the \textSymb{temoin_aspiration_manuelle}~switch on the overhead console to activate the suction system.
\item Apply the parking brake fully before leaving the driver’s cabin.
\item Use the suction duct flap to close the suction duct (see \in{§}[sSec:suctionClap], \atpage[sSec:suctionClap]).
\item Holding the mouthpiece, pull the manual suction hose out of its mount and commence clearing work.
\item Once your work is complete, press the \textSymb{temoin_aspiration_manuelle}~switch again to deactivate the suction system.
