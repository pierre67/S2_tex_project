\Boschung\ puts environmental protection\index{Environmental protection} into practice. We focus on the root causes and, when making business decisions, we take into account all the various ways that the production process and the product can impact on the environment. Our goals are to use resources sparingly and operate with due consideration for the natural environment which has to be protected for the benefit of mankind and nature. By adhering to certain rules when operating the vehicle you can also help to protect the environment. This also includes the adequate and proper handling of substances and materials during the course of vehicle maintenance (\eG\ disposing of chemicals and special waste).

How the vehicle is operated has a major impact on both fuel consumption and engine wear. We would therefore ask you to observe a number points:

\startitemize
\item Do not allow the engine to warm up at idling speed.
\item Switch off the engine during breaks in operation.
\item Regularly check fuel consumption.
\item {\em Have maintenance work carried out in line with the maintenance schedule and by a competent specialist workshop.}

\subsection [sSec:vw:diagTool]{On|-|board diagnostic system}

The\startregister[index][reg:main:vw]{Maintenance+Diesel engine} engine control unit (J623) is equipped with a fault memory.
If malfunctions occur in the sensors or components that are being monitored, they are stored in the fault memory with an indication of the type of fault.

After evaluating the information, the\index{Diesel engine+Diagnostics} engine control unit differentiates between the various types of fault and stores them until they are deleted from the fault memory.

Faults that only occur {\em sporadically}, are displayed with the suffix \aW{SP}. Sporadic faults can be caused by \eG\ a loose contact or a temporary open circuit in wiring. If a sporadic fault does not reoccur over the course of 50 engine starts, it is deleted from the fault memory.

If faults that influence engine operation are detected, the \aW{Engine diagnosis}~\textSymb{vpadWarningEngine1} monitoring icon lights up on the Vpad screen.

The stored faults can be read out using the vehicle diagnosis, testing and information system \aW{VAS 5051/B}.

Once the fault or faults have been rectified, the fault memory must be cleared.

A transparent level indicator\index{Fill level+Hydraulic fluid}\index{Maintenance+Hydraulic system} can be used to check the hydraulic oil fill level.
If the hydraulic oil fill level has dropped, the cause must be identified before the fill level is topped up. Comply with the stated change intervals (table above) and specifications for the hydraulic fluid (see table, \at{p.}[sec:liqquantities]).


\subsubsection{Topping up hydraulic fluid}

Add hydraulic fluid until the fill level reaches the middle of the level indicator.
Start the engine and, if necessary, top up the oil until the required fill level is obtained.


\subsection{Changing hydraulic fluid}

The fill volume and required specifications for the hydraulic fluid can be found in the table on \at{p.}[sec:liqquantities].

\startSteps
\item Open the filler cap of the hydraulic tank.
\item Use an oil extraction device or remove the drain plug to empty the tank.

The drain plug is located on the bottom of the hydraulic tank, in front of the left rear wheel (\in{Fig.}[fig:hydraulic:fluidDrain]).
\item Add hydraulic fluid until the fill level reaches the middle of the level indicator.

\startsection[title={Checking and maintaining the tires},
reference={sec:pneumatiques}]

The tires\index{Tires+Maintenance} must always be in perfect condition, so that they can fulfil their primary functions~– good road holding and perfect braking performance. Key factors that contribute to accidents include excessive wear and incorrect tire pressure, particularly tire pressures that are too low.


\subsection{Safety|-|relevant points}

\subsubsection{Checking wear}

Use the wear indicators located in the tread (\in{Fig.}[pneususure]) to check tire wear.
A visual check can be used to identify any problems with the tires and their causes:

\placefig[margin][pneususure]{Checking wear}
{\Framed{\externalfigure[pneusUsure][M]}}

\placefig[margin][pneusdomages]{Tire damage}
{\Framed{\externalfigure[pneusDomages][M]}}

\startitemize
\item Wear at the sides of the tread area: Tire pressure too low.
\item Intensified wear in the middle: Tire pressure too high.
\item Asymmetrical wear on the sides of the tire: Front axle (track, axle geometry) incorrectly set.
\item Cracks in the tread: Tires too old~– the rubber in tires becomes brittle over time and starts to crack (\in{Fig.}[pneusdomages]).
\stopitemize

\starttextbackground[CB]
\startPictPar
\PHgeneric
\PictPar
\textDescrHead{Risks associated with worn tires}
A worn tire no longer fulfils its functions, particularly in terms of water and mud displacement~– the braking distance is extended and driving performance impaired. A worn tire slips more easily, particularly in wet conditions. There is a greater risk that the tires will lose their ability to hold the road.
\stopPictPar
\stoptextbackground


\subsubsection{Tire pressure}

The prescribed tire pressure is indicated on the wheel specification plate at the front of the console, on the passenger side (see \atpage [sec:plateWheel]).

Even\index{Tires+Pressure} when the tires are in good condition, air escapes from them over time at varying rates (the more the vehicle is driven, the quicker the tire pressure will drop). Tire pressure should therefore be checked on a monthly basis and when the tires are cold. If you check the tire pressure when the tires are warm, you will need to add 0.3\,bar to the prescribed tire pressure.

A tire can rupture when its pressure is too low. When a tire has not been pumped up enough, or when the vehicle is overloaded, the tire becomes more compressed. This causes the rubber to get hot and parts of the tire may separate when taking a corner.
