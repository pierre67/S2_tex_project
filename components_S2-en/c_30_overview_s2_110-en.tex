The \sdeux\ sweeper vehicle is the culmination of the experience and expertise that Boschung has built up over decades of close and continuous collaboration with customers and partners.
Over this period, the requirements of municipal authorities and service providers have grown enormously with regard to mobility and versatility. The engineers behind the \sdeux\ have met these challenges head on, taking their lead from customer needs while striving to implement far||sighted improvements suggested by Boschung Customer Services.
This combination of customer focus and practical in||house experience has produced the \sdeux\ .


\subsection{Innovative technology}

The \sdeux\ compact sweeper vehicle stands out in its class due to its low weight (2300\,kg), high capacity (2.0\,m\high{3} dirt hopper), compact dimensions (1.15\,m wide) and exceptionally ergonomic operator environment.

Due to its narrow build, the \sdeux\ is a \quotation{go||anywhere} sweeper for roads and sidewalks in cities and villages. Its powerful diesel engine and compact hydrostatic drive (radial piston hydraulic motors on the front wheels) deliver maximum mobility at all times, regardless of the ground conditions at the deployment site and no matter how full the dirt hopper is.

The hydraulic pumps are powered by a \aW{VW 2.0 CDI} diesel engine that complies with the Euro V standard. It supplies 285\,Nm of torque at 1750~revolutions and a maximum output of 75\,kW at 3000~revolutions. This means that the machine can operate effectively even at low engine speeds~– and therefore with low noise emissions. The \sdeux\ comes with a particulate filter as standard.


\section{Innovation in the service of our customers}

The articulated steering of the \sdeux\ produces a tight turning circle and therefore ensures maximum maneuverability. By using special materials such as Domex® and developing the vehicle using CAD software at every stage, we have been able to achieve an impressive load capacity of 1200\,kg.

\placefig[margin][overview:cab:frontright]{\sdeux\ sweepers ready for deployment}
{\externalfigure[overview:cab:twoleft][width=\Bildwidth]}

The driver’s cabin features all||round glazing and two comfortable seats fitted with three||point safety belts. The \sdeux\ can be fitted with an optional air||conditioning system.

As the vehicle is capable of reaching up to 40\,km/h (approx. 25 mph) it can easily cope with urban traffic. Furthermore, thanks to the excellent front and rear axle suspension, it can negotiate even the most difficult terrain safely and comfortably.

The sweeper units~– mounted on two articulated arms~– are completely within the operator’s field of vision and the suction mouth is positioned in front of the front axle, where it is comfortably in view. A double articulated front broom can be mounted to the sweeper as an additional tool.

\page [yes]


\subsection{Soundproofed and comfortable driver’s cabin}

The driver’s cabin\index{Driver’s cabin} of the \sdeux\ is designed for right||hand steering and has space for two people. It is noise insulated and mounted on vibration||absorbing Silentblocs.

The doors and floor are glazed, which ensures operators have a broad field of vision. The windshield covers the entire front of the vehicle, providing an unobstructed view of the brooms.

The driver’s seat comes with mechanical or~– as an option~– pneumatic suspension. Both the driver and passenger seats are mounted on adjustable rails.


\subsubsubject{Ergonomics}

\startfigtext[right][overview:joy:sideview]{Operating console}
{\externalfigure[overview:joy:top]}
The multifunction console on the left of the driver’s seat ensures that all the key functions can be operated with one hand. The two brooms can be independently controlled by operating the two joysticks with thumb and index finger. The switches for the brooms, front broom (optional), engine speed, cruise control, etc. are also located on the multifunction console.
\stopfigtext

A touchscreen is located at the lower edge of the driver’s field of vision and displays all important information on machine functions in real time, without impairing the driver’s view to the outside.

\subsubsubject{Driver’s station}

The\index{Driver’s station} gearshift is situated to the right of the steering column and offers two forward gears and one reverse gear. A pushbutton on the end of the gearshift is used to switch between \aW{working} and \aW{driving} mode. The \sdeux\ does not need to be brought to a stop in order to switch between these two modes (see \about[sec:using:work], \atpage[sec:using:work]).

\placefig[margin][fig:overview:steeringwheel]{Driver’s station}
{\externalfigure[overview:driver:place]}

When driving in reverse, the monitor of the reversing camera is activated and a warning tone is sounded (this can be deactivated via the Vpad).

The multifunction lever on the left of the steering column incorporates the control for the windshield wiper (two levels and intermittent mode), headlight flash and horn.

See \about[chap:using] from \atpage[chap:using] for detailed information on these and other functions of the \sdeux.

\subsection[overview:brushsystem]{Vacuum sweeper system}

\subsubsubject{Brooms}

\startfigtext[left][fig:overview:steeringwheel]{Vacuum sweeper system}
{\externalfigure[system:brush]}
The brooms\index{Sweeping} are mounted on movable heads that are in turn mounted on articulated arms. The dust that is thrown up during sweeping is captured by being sprayed with water. Each broom is fitted with two spray nozzles that are supplied with water from the freshwater tank or recycled water tank.

A switch\index{Vacuum} on the multifunction console activates the brooms and water pump simultaneously.\footnote{For information on the water pump, see Section \in[chap:using] \about[chap:using], particularly \about[sec:using:work], \atpage[sec:using:work].}
The positions of the brooms and their lateral and longitudinal incline can be controlled directly from the relevant joystick on the multifunction console.
\stopfigtext

The brooms are protected by a mechanical and hydraulic anti||collision system.


\subsubsubject{Suction mouth}

When in its working position (lowered), the suction mouth rests on 4~casters and completely covers the space between the extended brooms. Because it is \quotation{dragged} it is largely protected from mechanical damage caused by collisions with obstacles. When the vehicle is in reverse, the suction mouth is automatically raised.

A thick, replaceable rubber lip creates a tight seal with the road surface. Thanks to an electrohydraulic flap on the front of the suction mouth, the device can also pick up larger debris.


\subsubsubject{Dirt hopper}

The aluminum dirt hopper can be raised to an angle of up to 50° and a height of 1.5\,m (drainage height). The suction duct runs to the bottom of the dirt hopper, where it terminates in an opening that measures 180\,mm in diameter.

The vacuum for the suction duct is generated by a high||performance turbine that is mounted horizontally in the dirt hopper. The turbine has a maintenance cover for cleaning and visual checks.

Two stainless steel suction grates are located in the hatch of the dirt hopper. They can be swung out for cleaning without the need for tools. The hatch can be unlocked and opened by hand.

A cover plate can be moved by hand to redirect the airflow between the suction duct and manual suction hose (optional equipment).


\subsection{Dampening system}

\subsubsubject{Freshwater system}

The\index{Sweeping+Dampening} tank, which is cast from PE, is located in an upright position behind the driver’s cabin. It\index{Freshwater+Tank} has a capacity of 190\,l.

An electric pump (6.5\,l/min) conveys the water to the spray nozzles above each broom (including an optional third broom).


\subsubsubject{Recycling system for dirty water}

Dirty water runs through the microperforations in the internal walls of the dirty water reservoir then through the recycling trap and into the recycled water tank underneath. The\index{Recycled water+Tank} recycled water tank holds 140\,l.

An hydraulic immersion pump conveys the water to the spray nozzles inside the suction mouth and suction duct.


\testpage [8]
\subsubsubject{Recycled water tank}

The recycled water tank is fitted with a water|/|hydraulic fluid heat exchanger that has a dual function:

\startitemize[width=35mm,style=\md, command={\setupwhitespace[small]}]
\sym{Function in summer} The water transfers heat from the hydraulic fluid by means of convection to the aluminum walls of the tank, from where it radiates into the surrounding air.

\sym{Function in winter} The hydraulic fluid heats the water in the tank. This means that the brooms can still be sprayed with water in temperatures that are slightly below freezing.
\stopitemize


\subsubsubject{Monitoring water fill levels}

\startitemize[width=35mm,style=\md, command={\setupwhitespace[small]}]
\sym{Freshwater} When the fill level is too low, the \textSymb{vpad_water}~icon appears on the Vpad screen.
\sym{Recycled water} When the fill level of the recycled water tank is below the level of the heat exchanger (see above), the \textSymb{vpad_rwater_orange}~icon (orange) appears on the Vpad screen. When the fill level is too low, the \textSymb{vpad_rwater}~(red) icon is displayed.
\stopitemize

\section{Vehicle identification}

\subsection{Vehicle specification plate}

The vehicle specification plate\index{Identification+Vehicle} is located in the driver’s cabin, opposite the console, under the passenger seat (see \inF[fig:identity:location], \atpage[fig:identity:location]).


\subsection{Engine code and number}

The engine code is located on the engine specification plate (sticker), which is on the elbowed metal pipe of the cooling circuit, at the front of the engine (raise the dirt hopper).

The engine number is engraved on the engine (\inF[identity:engine:number]). It comprises nine alphanumeric characters: The first three are the engine code and the following six make up the serial number of the engine.

\subsection [sec:plateWheel]{Wheel specification plate}

The specification plate for the wheel rims and tires\index{Tires+Pressure} is located in the driver’s cabin\index{Wheel rims+Dimensions}, underneath the passenger seat.


\subsection{Chassis number}

The chassis number\index{Identification+Chassis number} is stamped onto the chassis on the right||hand side of the vehicle, underneath the driver’s cabin.


\subsection{\symbol[europe][CEsign] conformity and labelling}

The \symbol[europe][CEsign]~labeling is located in the driver’s cabin, opposite the console and under the passenger seat.

The \sdeux\ complies with the fundamental health and safety requirements enshrined in Machinery Directive\index{Certificate+European conformity}\index{Machinery Directive} 2006/42/EC\footnote{Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and Council, dated 17~May 2006}.
